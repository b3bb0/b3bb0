### Coding my life away since 1999

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a lot stuff, but mostly on [wildjar](https://wildjar.com) stuff
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything really, but I doubt I'll reply quickly
- ðŸ“« Send a pigeon to Bondi Beach, I'll get it!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was always keen to code for way less than the pay was!
